             Why am I here?
                </h4>
                <p>
                   Well, I guess I love programming, for me it wasn't about if programming is my path in the future, i finished high school at one of the best Computer Science college in my country, I've been to competitions and followed courses
                   in C++, HTML, php and JavaScript. The thing is that i wanted to learn in a new way, so i decided to try my luck at a university in a foreign country, and now I am here

                    Extra-curricular activities
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Most of my extra-curricular activities were at least in some part programming related, courses on web development, internships, but not all, I love animals, I have 2 dogs and 3 cats back home, so occasionally i would go 
                  and work at an animal shelter in atown near my home, there I did anything that was needed: walking the dogs, cleaning the animals, feeding them.
